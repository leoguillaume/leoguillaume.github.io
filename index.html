Welcome to my data science blog :wave:! I'm LÃ©o and I'm data scientist,
I'have a academic background in Economics and Law, and recently in data sciences.
I'm passionate about applications of AI in law and the Natural Language Processing.
<br>
<br>
I am a junior and I love to learn and share with others :seedling:. My goal is
to write two articles/projects a week here on topics that interest me. I'm
also open to work and have a freelance status (feel free to contact me :grin:)!
