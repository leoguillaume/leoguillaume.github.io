Welcome to my data science blog :wave:! I'm Léo and I'm data scientist,
I've a academic background in Economics and Law, and recently in data sciences.
I'm passionate about applications of AI in Law, Natural Language Processing and web scrapping.
<br>
<br>
I am junior in data sciences, I love to learn and share with others :seedling:. My goal is
to write two articles/projects a week here on topics that interest me. I'm currently an apprentice, 
so I can't post as much as I'd like here and I'm a long term project that I'll hopefully be able 
to share here soon. 
I also have a freelance status (feel free to contact me :grin:), I open to new challenges!
