As part of my studies I had to deal with a case study: developing an application idea from the Open Food Fact database. This database gathers millions of food products found in the shops.

You can find on my github ([here](https://github.com/leoguillaume/Transfer-learning-Open-Food-Fact)) the code as well as the presentation in the readme of the imagined application.
