Scikit-learn pipelines are very useful tools to try and evaluate your ideas throughout all of a machine learning work to improve your model accuracy.

I have implemented pipelines for the famouse Titanic Kaggle Challenge. You can see the notebook **[here](https://www.kaggle.com/loguillaume/all-ml-steps-with-sklearn-pipeline)**.

In this notebook I present some tricks with the Scikit-learn pipelines to realised all ML step (data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, feature selection...).
