Have facebook messenger chats with a friend or a group since many years and where hundreds or thousands of photos have been shared ? If so, you probably figured like me that it would be cool to retrieve all these photos before they are lost forever in the maze of the internet.

After research, there isn't turnkey solution to do that. So, I wrote a python script :sunglasses:! This script use `fbchat` to scrape and `urlib` to save your images. With it, I downloaded more than 4000 images from my high school friends group.

You'll find all informations about the script and how run it in the following repo : [fbm-image-scraper](https://github.com/leoguillaume/fbm-image-scraper)
